# Neural Network Effect
In this repository you can find a project I made to experiment with OpenFramworks and creative code. 
It is an effect similar to that of neural networks. 
The particles move randomly but are spatially restricted according to the position of the user. 
The webcam captures a portion of space and based on the movement recognises where the particles should disappear.

# How To Test
To test the application, all you have to do is create a new OpenFrameworks project, open it with Visual Studio and place the files in the src folder. 
The data is not strictly necessary, there is only a video inside and it served as an initial test for the experiment. The code on how to replace the webcam with the video is commented out.
