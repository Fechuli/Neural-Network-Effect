# Neural-Network-Effect
In this repository you can find a project I made to experiment with OpenFramworks and creative code. 
It is an effect similar to that of neural networks. 
The particles move randomly but are spatially restricted according to the position of the user. 
The webcam captures a portion of space and based on the movement recognises where the particles should disappear.
